# Vali - create GeoGuessr locations like a pro
The creator of *An Arbitrary World*,  *An Arbitrary Rural World*, *Dirty World*, *IntersectionGuessr* ++ brings you Vali - the next evolution in computer generating GeoGuessr maps. With this tool **you** can create "An Arbitrary Rural Southern Europe", "Coastal Sri Lanka", "Skewed Africa" or something brand new. More than 100 million possible locations are awaiting - be creative.

# What is Vali?
Vali uses a massive pool of pre-generated Google street view locations combined with specific data from OpenStreetMap and Nominatim to provide a tool that can generate locations based on your preferences. The creation and update of the locations happens outside of Vali and is not part of this repository. You provide a specification of what type of locations you want in the form of a JSON file, and Vali will give you locations you can upload to [map-making.app](https://map-making.app/) or GeoGuessr.

# First time setup
* Install [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).
* Install [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install#install) (or use another terminal).
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or use another text editor suitable for editing JSON files.
* Open Windows Terminal and run `dotnet tool install -g vali`
* To update to the latest version, if you already have it installed - run `dotnet tool update -g vali`

# Getting started
* `vali create-file` - Create a JSON file to start off.
* Open the JSON file that was just created in Visual Studio Code. Edit it if you want.
* `vali generate --file "NO.json"` - Generate locations based on the JSON file specified.

# Commands
* `vali generate --file norway.json` - Generate locations based on specification in `norway.json`.
* `vali subdivisions --country "ES"` - Export default subdivision distribution data for Spain as JSON.
* `vali subdivisions --country "ES" --text` - Export default subdivision distribution data for Spain as text.
* `vali countries "ES,FR,IT"` - Export default country distribution data for Spain as JSON.
* `vali countries "ES,FR,IT" --distribution "abw"` - Export country distribution data for Spain, France and Italy as specified by "A Balanced World" as JSON.
* `vali countries "*" --distribution "aiw" --text` - Export country distribution data for all countries as specified by "An Improved World" as text.
* `vali report --country "NO" --prop "County"` - Export counties/municipalities data for Norway.
* `vali report --country "BE" --prop "Year"` - Export coverage year data for Belgium.
* `vali download` - Download/update data. You will be asked which countries you want to download data for.

* `vali unset-download-folder` - Reset download folder to default.
* `vali application-settings` - Read application settings.

# Buliding blocks
Go directly to [full examples](#full-examples) or [properties](#properties) if you prefer not to read.

## Selecting countries
You need to specify which countries you want to include in the `countryCodes` array. Example:
```json
{
  "countryCodes": ["EC", "CO", "PE", "BO"]
}
```
## Distribution strategy
You can select between different strategies for distributing locations. Option 1 is `FixedCountByMaxMinDistance` where you specify how many locations you want in total and each subdivision will get their locations spread as far away from each other as possible. You can set a minimum minimum distance to set a lower limit on how close each location can be to each other. This is the recommended approach for most. Example:
```json
{
  "distributionStrategy": {
    "key": "FixedCountByMaxMinDistance",
    "locationCountGoal": 45000,
    "minMinDistance": 200
  }
}
```

Option 2 is `MaxCountByFixedMinDistance` where you specify how far you want each location to be from each other in `FixedMinDistance` and it finds the maximum amount of locations *still upholding the subdivision distribution*. Example:
```json
{
  "distributionStrategy": {
    "key": "MaxCountByFixedMinDistance",
    "FixedMinDistance": 200
  }
}
```
## Specific country distribution
You can specify a country distribution of your choice. All numbers are relative (not representing location counts) and must be integers. Example:
```json
{
  "countryDistribution": {
    "NO": 200,
    "SE": 220,
    "FI": 200,
    "DK": 140
  }
}
```
Use `vali countries --country "NO,SE,FI,DK"` to output the default distribution, so you can copy it and make adjustments suitable to your map.

## Specific subdivision distribution(s)
You can specify one or more subdivision distribution to override the default one(s). All numbers are relative (not representing location counts) and must be integers. You can output the default subdivision distribution as JSON with the command `vali subdivisions --country "NO"` (or `vali subdivisions --country "NO" --text` to get a textual representation) Example:
```json
{
  "subdivisionDistribution": {
    "NO": {
      "NO-03": 200,
      "NO-15": 1500
    },
    "SE": {
      "SE-AB": 1000,
      "SE-AC": 1500,
      "SE-BD": 2000
    }
  }
}
```
Use `vali subdivisions --country "NO"` to output the default distribution, so you can copy it and make adjustments suitable to your map.

## Include or exclude subdivisions
Sometimes it can be handy to include or excludle a few subdivisions. F.ex. include only African Spain or exclude European TÃ¼rkiye. Examples:
```json
{
  "subdivisionInclusions": {
    "ES": [
      "ES-CN",
      "ES-CE",
      "ES-ML"
    ]
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "subdivisionExclusions": {
    "TR": [
      "TR-22",
      "TR-39",
      "TR-59",
      "TR-34"
    ]
  }
}
```
## Location filtering
Locations can be filtered globally, per country or per subdivision.

With these building blocks we can write queries/expressions to filter out certain locations. Some examples:

| Query                                             | Description

| `Month gte 9 and Month lte 11`                    | Autumn coverage.
| `Year lte 2010`                                   | Gen2.
| `Roads200 eq 1 and Buildings200 eq 0`             | Rural coverage.
| `ClosestCoast lt 100`                             | Coastal coverage.
| `Buildings25 gte 3 and Buildings100 gte 6`        | Urban-ish coverage?
| `Surface eq 'gravel' or Surface eq 'fine_gravel'` | Gravel roads?

## Filter locations globally
```json
{
  "globalLocationFilter": "ClosestCoast lt 100 and Buildings100 gte 4"
}
```

## Filter locations per country
```json
{
  "countryLocationFilters": {
    "GR": "ClosestCoast lt 100 and Buildings100 gte 4"
  }
}
```

## Filter locations per subdivision
```json
{
  "subdivisionLocationFilters": {
    "GR": {
      "GR-M": "ClosestCoast lt 50",
      "GR-L": "ClosestCoast lt 100"
    }
  }
}
```

## Location preference filtering
Sometimes you want a certain percentage of your map to contain one type of locations. Vali can help you try and achieve that. It's called preference filters and can be applied globally/per country or per subdivision. The filtering is applied *after* any location filtering as described above. Example showing how to achieve 25 % locations on unpaved roads and filling in the rest with any location:
```json
{
  "globalLocationPreferenceFilters": [
    {
      "expression": "Surface neq 'paved' and Surface neq 'asphalt'",
      "percentage": 25,
      "fill": false
    },
    {
      "expression": "*",
      "percentage": null,
      "fill": true
    }
  ]
}
```
```json
{
  "countryLocationPreferenceFilters": {
    "ES": [
      {
        "expression": "Surface neq 'paved' and Surface neq 'asphalt'",
        "percentage": 25,
        "fill": false
      },
      {
        "expression": "*",
        "percentage": null,
        "fill": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "subdivisionLocationPreferenceFilters": {
    "ES": {
      "ES-AN": [
        {
          "expression": "Surface neq 'paved' and Surface neq 'asphalt'",
          "percentage": 25,
          "fill": false
        },
        {
          "expression": "*",
          "percentage": null,
          "fill": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
## Location output adjustments
You can adjust the zoom on locations with `globalZoom` (range 0-3.6) and set the pitch with `globalPitch` (range -90 to 90). Heading can be set with `globalHeadingExpression` or `countryHeadingExpressions`. Examples:
```json
{
  "output": {
    "globalHeadingExpression": "DrivingDirectionAngle + 90"
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "output": {
    "countryHeadingExpressions": {
      "FR": "DrivingDirectionAngle + 90",
      "GB": "DrivingDirectionAngle + 270"
    }
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "output": {
    "globalHeadingExpression": "",
    "globalPitch": -30,
    "globalZoom": 2.4
  }
}
```

## Country code expansions
Most places that accept country code, can also accept special keywords that will expand into multiple country codes. Possible values:
* \* -> All countries.
* europe -> Countries in Europe. If you only specify europe, inclusions and exclusions will also be filled when generating maps.
* asia -> Countries in Asia. If you only specify asia, inclusions and exclusions will also be filled when generating maps.
* africa -> Countries in Africa. If you only specify africa, inclusions and exclusions will also be filled when generating maps.
* southamerica -> Countries in South America.
* northamerica -> Countries in North America. If you only specify northamerica, inclusions and exclusions will also be filled when generating maps.
* oceania -> Countries in oceania. If you only specify oceania, inclusions and exclusions will also be filled when generating maps.
* lefthandtraffic -> Countries that drive on the left side of the road.
* righthandtraffic -> Countries that drive on the right side of the road.

}
```

# Please remember
* Location count is not everything. The same goes for location spread and lack of clustering.
* Not all roads with coverage are included. It's ok. More will be added. And there are more than 100 million possible locations.
* Data quality can vary wildly, especially when it comes to OpenStreetMap. While that can be frustrating, it's just the way it is. Go contribute to make things better.
* Computer generating maps can be great, but it will not fully replace handpicked maps.
* This is a complex piece of software. Do not expect zero bugs.

# Potentially asked questions
> Can you turn it into a webpage?

I don't think so. Currently it's a very resource intensive program. Downloading/processing 15 GB of data is not something a web site is suitable for.

> Why is Vali a command line application?

Because I have very little interest in creating a user interface for it, especially before it gains any kind of popularity.

> Can you include more locations/roads in country X?

Maybe. The best chance for that is if you generate a JSON or csv with "Filter by minimum distance from locations" set to 1 km with as many locations as possible in country X and send it to me on discord. Only one country per file.

> Why are there (relatively) few locations on straight stretches of road?

Each location in the location pool corresponds to an OSM "node". Nodes exist to describe roads and other features, so naturally there will be more locations in places with curves, buildings, other roads etc.
